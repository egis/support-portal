## Filter spam or unwanted messages out
1.  Create one or more **Email Imports** with a Rule Order of 1.  
2.  Specify unwanted terms under the **Field** Tab e.g.  
3.  Create all other **Email Imports** with a Rule Order larger than 1.  

## Import emails from one email account with multiple aliases

1.  Create one **email account**.  
2.  Create one or more email import and specify the alias under the **Rules -> To** and **Rules -> CC** fields.  
3.  Select the **email account** created under step 1.  

## Map email fields to document indexes

1.  Select the **node to import the emails to**.
2.  Map the **fields** under the **Fields** tab.

## Exclude signature images and other attachments from being imported.

1.  Under the **rules** tab, specify a semi-colon separated list of **unwanted extensions** under Attachment Exclusion Filter.
e.g. *.gif;*.jpeg;*.png


OR


2.  Specify only the attachments you want to import under **Attachment Inclusion Filter**.
*.pdf;*.doc*

Update the original email when a reply is received (threading)

## Import emails from Office365 OAuth - Delegated Access

To set up:<br>
URL = https://login.microsoftonline.com/<br>
Add username<br>
Add password<br>
Add the tenantId in Advanced<br>
Add the clientId in Advanced<br>
Add the resource in Advanced<br>

e.g. in Advanced:<br>
```properties
tenantId=12345
clientId=abcde
resource=EWS.AccessAsUser.All
```


## Import emails from Office365 OAuth - Application Access

### To set up:
URL = `https://login.microsoftonline.com/`  
Add User Email as `username`  
Add Client Secret as `password`  
Add the `tenantId` in Advanced  
Add the `clientId` in Advanced  
Add the `resource` in Advanced  
Add the `secret=true` in Advance

e.g. in Advanced:<br>
```properties
tenantId=12345
clientId=abcde
resource=https://outlook.office.com/.default
secret=true
```

## Troubleshooting email imports:

1.  Ensure that standard email clients can connect over the POP and IMAP Protocols.
2.  Check **Services -> Properties -> Imports -> Debug POP/IMAP** to record the conversion with the POP/IMAP server to if it returns any error messages.

## Polling mail servers with a self-signed certificate
Should you not be able to connect to a mailbox, with the below error in the logfile, the issue is due to a certificate not in the Java cacerts file:<br>
`PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target`

1. Obtain a copy of the CER file for the mailserver and save on disk to the PaperTrail server (mailserver.cer in this example)
2. Run CMD prompt as administrator / Linux shell as root
3. Navigate to the Java bin directory:<br>
 - Windows: `C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_221\bin`<br>
 - Linux: `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin`<br>
4. Import the certificate to the Java Security cacerts file<br>
 - Windows: `keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -file "C:\Downloads\mailserver.cer" -keystore "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_221\lib\security\cacerts" -alias "mailserver"`<br>
 - Linux: `keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -file /root/mailserver.cer -keystore /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/lib/security/cacerts -alias mailserver`<br>
5. Set the password to `changeit` and trust the certificate
6. Restart PaperTrail
7. If there is still an issue, try adding this line to run.sh / service_x64.vmoptions and restart PaperTrail<br>
 - Windows `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_221\lib\security\cacerts`<br>
 - Linux `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/lib/security/cacerts`<br>

### How to obtain the self-signed certificate file
1. OpenSSL command is available on Linux or Install OpenSSL for Windows (releases under the OpenSSL node)
2. On Linux systems, openssl should be available to run in the CLI
3. Windows only: Open CMD prompt as Administrator, Navigate to C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin<br>
`echo | openssl s_client -connect mymailserver.com:port 2>&1 > mailserver.cer`
4. Replace `mymailserver.com:port` with the relevant details, e.g. `mail.server.co.za:993`
5. Edit mailserver.cer and add BEGIN CERTIFICATE AND END CERTIFICATE lines around the certificate as below<br>
`-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`<br>
`-----END CERTIFICATE-----`

## Issues polling mail servers with TLS
Should you not be able to connect to a mailbox, with the below error in the logfile, the issue is due to a Java update which disables legacy TLS protocols:<br>
`Failed to connect to: mailbox@outlook.office365.com:993 javax.mail.MessagingException: No appropriate protocol (protocol is disabled or cipher suites are inappropriate); nested exception is: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: No appropriate protocol (protocol is disabled or cipher suites are inappropriate)`

It appears that a release of Java around April 2021 disables TLSv1 and TLSv1.1.
The below lines in the java.security file (\Java\jre1.8.0_291\lib\security) should be commented out and PaperTrail restarted:<br>
`#jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, RC4, DES, MD5withRSA, \`<br>
`#    DH keySize < 1024, EC keySize < 224, 3DES_EDE_CBC, anon, NULL, \`<br>
`#    include jdk.disabled.namedCurves`

## Issues with *Remote host closed connection during handshake*
Should you not be able to connect to a mailbox, with the below error in the logfile, the issue is due to an outdated mail.jar file in the PaperTrail libs directory<br>
`Failed to connect to: mailbox@mail.com@mailserver:993 javax.mail.MessagingException: Remote host closed connection during handshake;`

The offending mail.jar is v1.4.4, with the updated jar being v1.6.2

1. Remove `mail.jar` from the libs directory
2. Obtain v1.6.2 of `javax.mail.jar`, rename to `mail.jar` and place in the libs directory (https://javaee.github.io/javamail/#Download_JavaMail_Release)
3. Restart PaperTrail

## Polling email servers via a Proxy
Should PaperTrail be forced to use a proxy server for outside connectivity, PaperTrail 889 b2479 onward is required with the below settings:<br>
`mail.ewsstore.proxy.host=myproxyhost` (proxy host - required)<br>
`mail.ewsstore.proxy.port=80` (proxy port - required)<br>
If the proxy requires authentication, the following settings are required:<br>
`mail.ewsstore.proxy.user=myuser`<br>
`mail.ewsstore.proxy.password=mypassword`<br>

Note that these proxy settings are specific to email imports and differ from the general proxy settings needed to reach, for example, SMS gateways
